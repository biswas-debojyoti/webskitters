        <h1>1. What is react ?</h1>
        <p> Ans.
                React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>
        <h1>2. What is dom ? Types of dom?</h1>
        <p>Ans.
                The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It defines the
                logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
                
                The DOM is separated into three ( 3 )parts: A.Core,
                B.HTML,
                C. XML.</p>
        <h1>3. What is hook?  </h1>
        <h1>4. What is router ?</h1>
        <p>Ans.
                React Router is a JavaScript framework that lets us handle client and server-side routing in React applications. It
                enables the creation of single-page web or mobile apps that allow navigating without refreshing the page.</p>
        <h1>5. Explain about virtual dom ?</h1>
        <p>Ans.
                Virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the real DOM. When state changes occur, the virtual DOM is updated and the
                previous and current version of virtual DOM is compared. This is called “diffing”. The virtual DOM then sends a batch
                update to the real DOM to update the UI.</p>
        <h1>6. What is real dom ?</h1>
        <p>Ans.
                It is a structured representation of HTML in the webpage or application. It represents the entire UI(User Interface) of
                the web application as the tree data structure. It is a structural representation of HTML elements of a web application</p>
        <h1>7. What is Params?</h1>
        <p>Ans.
                We can use it to retrieve route parameters from the component rendered by the matching route</p>
